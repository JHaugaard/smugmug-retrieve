Gathering information for a web app to pull down assets from Smugmug account.

API Documentation: https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/doc

I am interested in building a web app or apps to accomplish the following:

Part 1
Connect to a Smugmug account (I have subscriber credentials)
Download images - either individually or in some bulk or batch process
Retain as much of the metadata stored with the Smugmug images as possible
Save those images, with metadata in a BackBlaze B2 bucket
The API documentation is found at: https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/doc
Create an interface and structure to manage the images with tasks including renaming, keywords, tagging, etc.
The app need not support image processing or editing.

Part 2
The B2 stored images should then be available for use on a newly built portfolio site, built for that purpose, and hosted either on a Hostinger VPS or on a Hostinger shared hosting site
